# D3-challenge

## Data Journalism and D3

Created a scatter plot with three options on both the x and y axis.

The x axis allows the choice of In Poverty, Age, and Household Income.  The y axis options
are Lacks Healthcare, Obesity, and Smokes.

Data was imported from a csv file.  The file contained the information by state. The data was
plotted using a circle for each state and the circle contains the abbreviation of the state.  A
tool tip is displayed when the mouse is over the circle.  The tool tip displays the state name
and the label and value for the selected option on each of the axes.
