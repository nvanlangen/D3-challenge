          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>One of the correlations identified was that the percentage of smokers was higher in states with a lower median 
            household income.  Obesity was also higher in the states with lower household income.  The percentage of residents
            lacking healthcare was higher in the states with lower median household incomes but the outcome was not as clear
            as with smoking and obesity.  There some states that had higher median income but also had a high percentage of
            residents without healthcare and vice versa.
          </p>

          <p>Not surprisingly, there was a strong correlation between the percentage of residents living in povery and median
            household income.  For all the health risks that were reviewed changing the selection from In Poverty to Household
            Income resulted in the data being plotted in an opposite manner.
          </p>

          <p>Age did not appear to be a significant factor in any of the data reviewed.  This may be due to only analyzing the median
            age.  If more detailed age results were included in the dataset there likely would be some correlation.
